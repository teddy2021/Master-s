\section{Question 1}
\subsection{C}
The accuracy of first visit MC in a deterministic environment is 100\% around 45\% of the time.
That is, with 20 runs, the result is 100\% 7/20 times.

\subsection{D}
With 1,000 iterations, the MC policy results in a lower bound of 2\% and upper of 51.4\% in 20 runs.
On the other hand with 10,000 iterations, MC's bounds become 4\% and 99.4\%


\section{Question 2}
\subsection{A}
With 1,000 iterations, SARSA and Q-Learning both have 100\% all of the time in 20 runs, in a deterministic environment.
In a stochastic environment with 1,000 iterations SARSA has bounds of [6\%, 39.8\%].
With 10,000 iterations the bounds become [13.6\%, 100\%]

\subsection{B}
With 1,000 iterations, Q-Learning has 100\% accuracy in all 20 runs.
With a stochastic environment it has bounds of [3\%, 59.4\%] with 1,000 iterations.
With 10,000 iterations the bounds become [6.4\%, 71.6\%]

\subsection{C}
Setting the non-success terminal states to have a reward of -1 gave an average
result of 51.86\% with a variance of 1482.8846 for temporal difference, and 
99.99\% with a variance of 0.002 for q-learning.
