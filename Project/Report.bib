@article{Angermann2019,
   abstract = {Convolutional neural networks are state-of-the-art for various segmentation
tasks. While for 2D images these networks are also computationally efficient,
3D convolutions have huge storage requirements and therefore, end-to-end
training is limited by GPU memory and data size. To overcome this issue, we
introduce a network structure for volumetric data without 3D convolution
layers. The main idea is to include projections from different directions to
transform the volumetric data to a sequence of images, where each image
contains information of the full data. We then apply 2D convolutions to these
projection images and lift them again to volumetric data using a trainable
reconstruction algorithm. The proposed architecture can be applied end-to-end
to very large data volumes without cropping or sliding-window techniques. For a
tested sparse binary segmentation task, it outperforms already known standard
approaches and is more resistant to generation of artefacts.},
